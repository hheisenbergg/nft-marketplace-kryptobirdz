This project represents a decentralized NFT Marketplace "KRYPTOBIRDZ" where a user is allowed to be a seller , minting his/her own NFTs into the market , or a buyer purchasing NFTs that are up on sale on the marketplace or both. 
Pre - requisite to access the features of the Marketplace are :
1. A crypto wallet to login in to the marketplace , that is compatible with the marketplace's underlying technology (i.e Ethereum)
2. An amount of coins in their wallet (Ethers)

With the above two things anyone can engage in the marketplace being a collector or a creator and deep dive into the world fo NFTs and understand the potential digital assets possess.
